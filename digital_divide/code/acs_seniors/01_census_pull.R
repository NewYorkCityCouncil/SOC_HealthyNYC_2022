### REQUEST ------------
# map of senior population and internet metric 

## OUTLINE TEXT for Reference ##
# Close the Digital Divide to advance health and opportunity for youth, older adults and NYers with disabilities 
# > Device Donation Program â€“ Connect old equipment from city agencies and private donors to those in need (based on programs in San Francisco and New Orleans) 
# > Digital Literacy Programming at DFTA 
# > Digital Literacy and Assistive Technology Investments for NYers with disabilities 

# check ACS 2019 & 2020 5 Year Tables at the Census Tract level;
# check PUMS 2019 & 2020, it has sample individual level data;
# check what internet metrics are there;
# then decide whether to aggregate up to NTA, CDTA, or PUMA


# example PUMS code -----------

# function to unzip shapefile -----------

  download.file(zip_url, temp)
  #unzip the contents in 'temp' and save unzipped content in 'temp2'
  unzip(zipfile = temp, exdir = temp2)
  #if returns "character(0), then .shp may be nested within the folder
  your_SHP_file <- ifelse(!identical(list.files(temp2, pattern = ".shp$",full.names=TRUE), character(0)),
