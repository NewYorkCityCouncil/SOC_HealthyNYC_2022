### REQUEST ------------
# map of senior population and internet metric 

## OUTLINE TEXT for Reference ##
# Close the Digital Divide to advance health and opportunity for youth, older adults and NYers with disabilities 
# For the internet access map, they would like it to show broadband access overall, not specific population and 
# perhaps numbers or bar chart seeing which groups (seniors, disabled, low-income, nonwhite, etc) 
# have lower rates compared to the city overall.

# function to unzip shapefile -----------

unzip_sf <- function(zip_url) {
  temp <- tempfile()
  temp2 <- tempfile()
  #download the zip folder from the internet save to 'temp' 
  download.file(zip_url, temp)
  #unzip the contents in 'temp' and save unzipped content in 'temp2'
  unzip(zipfile = temp, exdir = temp2)
  #if returns "character(0), then .shp may be nested within the folder
  your_SHP_file <- ifelse(!identical(list.files(temp2, pattern = ".shp$",full.names=TRUE), character(0)), 
                          list.files(temp2, pattern = ".shp$",full.names=TRUE), 
                          list.files(list.files(temp2, full.names=TRUE), pattern = ".shp$", full.names = TRUE))
  unlist(temp)
  unlist(temp2)
  return(your_SHP_file)
}

### Pull and clean data -----------

# pums_variables contains both the variables as well as their possible values. So letâ€™s just look at the unique variables.
