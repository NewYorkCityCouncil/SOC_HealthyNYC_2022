### COVID's Impact & Health Disparities

**Covid death rate map takeaways**

* Severe previous health conditions in a zip code (Comorbidity Severity Index) is strongly correlated with high COVID-19 death rates. 
* On the map there is clear overlap between areas with the highest COVID-19 death rates (darker shades of blue) and areas that are in the top 25% in terms of severe health conditions (highlighted with a purple border). 
* COVID-19 deaths rates and comorbidities tend to be clustered rather than evenly spread across the city.

**Health & Population Disparities Table takeaways**

* The characteristics of a zip code are correlated with the COVID-19 death rate of the area. 
* The zip code with the highest covid-19 death rate, East New York, has the highest comorbidity index (100th percentile), one of the lowest incomes (96th percentile), the highest percentage of seniors (100th percentile). 
* Each neighborhood in the top 5 of COVID-19 death rates has at least one characteristic ranked in the top 15%.

### Expanding Health 

Access to Ambulatory Care & Diagnostic Facilities

![Map of NYC showing Neighborhood Tabulation Areas (NTA) where areas with more access to hospitals/clinics are colored darker](https://newyorkcitycouncil.github.io/SOC_HealthyNYC_2022/health_care/visual/NYC_Health_Access_Map.png)

#### Takeaways
Since we are looking purely at land area and hospitals and clinics locations for ‘access’, this map represents the distribution of hospitals and diagnostic and treatment clinics within the 5 boroughs.
*	Manhattan and Bronx have easy access to a hospitals and clinics wherever they are, with very few exceptions such as Hunts Point (BX0201) in the Bronx.
*	Much of Brooklyn has easy access to a hospitals and clinics wherever they are as well, with few exceptions on the edges of the landmass such as Canarsie (BK1803).
*	Queens’ hospitals and clinics are more spread out in distance, with areas like Maspeth (QN0501) and Middle Village (QN0504) having less (walkable) access to hospitals and clinics compared to surrounding neighborhoods.
*	Staten Island has its few hospitals and clinics in the northern half of the island.

### Food Insecurity

Supply gap map 

* The map reveals multiple areas with supply gaps that currently have none or few EFAP providers (e.g., most of Staten Island, the Bayside area of Queens, Middle Village, Steinway, Van Cortlandt Village). 
* Even some areas with EFAP providers still have a relatively high supply gap (e.g., Elmhurst, LES, Bedford, Harlem). 
* There are many EFAP providers in the Crown Heights and East Flatbush area which is reflected in a lower supply gap in many but not all the neighborhoods there.

### Park Access

Covid death rate & park access

* Many New Yorkers are still without adequate park access highlighted by the cluster in Queens that includes Elmhurst & Jackson Heights. 
* Lower income areas in NYC have higher COVID-19 death rates. 
* Fifty-five percent of areas with high covid rates have low park access. 
* Adequate park access is crucial for these communities.
