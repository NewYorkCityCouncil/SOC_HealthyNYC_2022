### Expanding Health 

Access to Ambulatory Care & Diagnostic Facilities

![Map of NYC showing Neighborhood Tabulation Areas (NTA) where areas with more access to hospitals/clinics are colored darker](https://newyorkcitycouncil.github.io/SOC_HealthyNYC_2022/health_care/visual/NYC_Health_Access_Map.png)

#### Takeaways
Since we are looking purely at land area and hospital/clinic locations for ‘access’, this map represents the distributions of hospitals and clinics within the 5 boroughs.
*	Manhattan and Bronx have easy access to a hospital/clinic wherever they are, with very few exceptions such as Hunts Point (BX0201) in the Bronx.
*	Much of Brooklyn has easy access to a hospital/clinic wherever they are as well, with few exceptions on the edges of the landmass such as Canarsie (BK1803).
*	Queens’ hospitals/clinics are more spread out in distance, with areas like Maspeth (QN0501) and Middle Village (QN0504) having much less (walkable) access to hospitals and clinics compared to surrounding neighborhoods.
*	Staten Island has most of its few hospitals/clinics in the northern half of the island.
